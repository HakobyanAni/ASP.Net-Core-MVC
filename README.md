# ASP.Net-Core - MVC

<h2>What is ASP.NET Core ?</h2>

<h4>ASP.NET Core is the new web framework from Microsoft. It has been redesigned from the ground up to be fast, flexible, modern,
and work across different platforms.</br>
</br>
ASP.NET Core is an open source and cloud-optimized web framework for developing modern web applications that can be developed 
and run on Windows, Linux and the Mac. It includes the MVC framework, which now combines the features of MVC and Web API into a single 
web programming framework.</h4>

<h2>What is the MVC pattern ?</h2>
</br>
<h4>ASP.NET Core MVC is a rich framework for building web apps and APIs using the Model-View-Controller design pattern.
<p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using this pattern, user requests are routed to a Controller which is responsible for working with the Model to perform user actions and/or retrieve results of queries. The Controller chooses the View to display to the user, and provides it with any Model data it requires.</p></h4>
